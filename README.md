# FIFA 13 Career Mode Realistic – Rebalance Edition

This project is a careful rework of Gugabelletti's Career Mode mod for FIFA 13.
The objective is not to reinvent the mod, but to:

-   Keep / potentially improve what works : growth and retirement logics, no platinum regens
-   Remove risky or unstable settings
-   Improve balance without over-modifying core systems

This version is rebuilt directly from FIFA 13 Vanilla settings to ensure maximum stability.
